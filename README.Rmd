The goal of predicttornado is to provide functions that help with the data analysis of predicting the number of fatalities using length and width of tornadoes based on tornado data. 

## Functions included 

- `process_data`: Removes NA values in `mag` variable and repetitive/irrelevant columns from data frame and  renames column names in a specific order given that original columns in dataset are in the correct order.

- `create_scatterplot`: Creates a scatter plot from the provided data and specified two numerical 
columns with specific size, aesthetics, and font size settings. 

- `boxplot_viz`: Creates a boxplot of a variable of interest where outliers or skewed data may be a concern. 

- `fit_linear_model`: Creates and fits a linear model to the training data with linear regression and returns regression coefficients. 

- `accuracy_plot`: Creates a scatter plot from the provided data comparing the accuracy of a regression model to the actual observations.

## Place within the R package ecosystem

`predicttornado` may seem like a package very similar to other R packages. For example, we have three visualization functions that resemble `ggplot2`. However, they are all slightly different and more tailored to our data analysis project. `create_scatterplot`and `boxplot_viz` have specific visualization size settings and title and aesthetics that render your visualizations more pleasing.

Moreover, `accuracy_plot` is very different because even though it uses `ggplot2` functions, it creates a scatterplot that compares the accuracy of a linear regression model to the actual observations.

`process_data` is also different from `dplyr`â€™s `select` and `filter` as it combines these different functions to create an efficient data processing function for ease of data analysis. Additionally, it is a specific processing function for analysis tornado data in predicting fatalities.

Lastly, `fit_linear_model` is also different from other linear regression functions such as `lm` from `stats` for example because it combines multiple steps required in creating and fitting a linear regression model and then automatically outputs the model coefficient and intercept.


## Installation

You can install the development version of predicttornado like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DSCI-310-2024/predicttornado")
```

## Usage

Refer to the
[vignettes](https://github.com/DSCI-310-2024/predicttornado/blob/main/vignettes/predicttornado-vignette.Rmd)
for a more detailed guide on how to use our package functions.

```
library(predicttornado)
```

`process_data`: 

```
clean_data <- process_data(tornado_df)
```

`create_scatterplot`: 

```
width_fatalities_scatterplot <- create_scatterplot(clean_df, width, fatalities) + 
ggplot2::labs(x = "Width of tornadoes (yards)", y = "Fatalities", 
title = "Figure 2: Scatterplot of width (yards) of tornado and fatalities")
```

`boxplot_viz`:

```
fatalities_boxplot <- boxplot_viz(clean_df, fatalities)
```

`fit_linear_model`:

```
lm_data <- fit_linear_model(fatalities ~ width + length, clean_df) |>
    predict(clean_df) |>
    bind_cols(clean_df)
```

`accuracy_plot`: 

```
fatalities_accuracy_plot <- accuracy_plot(clean_df, fatalities) + 
labs(x = "Actual Number of Fatalities", y = "Predicted Number of Fatalities")
```
